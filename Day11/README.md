## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to classify resumes into job categories using machine learning techniques. The system processes textual content from resumes and applies classification models to predict the appropriate job category. The project integrates TF-IDF vectorization, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Classification (SVC) for classification and features a Streamlit-based web interface for easy deployment.

## üöÄ Features

Resume Classification: Predicts job categories from resume content.

Text Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw text for analysis.

TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts textual data into numerical format.

Machine Learning Models: Implements KNN and SVC for classification.

Multi-Format Resume Support: Accepts PDF, DOCX, and TXT file uploads.

Interactive UI: Deploys a user-friendly interface with Streamlit.
